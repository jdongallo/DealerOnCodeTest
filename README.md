# DealerOn Candidate Code Test

Typescript application to take coordinates of a "Mars rover" and output its
final position and which direction it is facing. Code in the rover.ts file
contains a class which holds the variables of the rover as well as the functions
to send it through its path. The cardinal direction is represented by x and y
values that are added to the rover's position whenever it moves. The program
processes the instructions string one character at a time, either rotating the
rover or moving it along the direction it is facing. To provide input to the
application, run the js file with Node and enter each line in the same format as
the test input in the pdf, hitting enter after each line. Once all the lines 
have been input, stop the process with Ctrl+C and the output will be displayed.
